# Arthur Acker

Hi, I'm Arthur Acker and I am a student at McGill University, currently studying Statistics and Computer Science. I am interested in Data and its many uses. I love handling data and producing something meaningful with it, such as showing the data in an aesthetic way everyone can understand it.
I have experience in Python, R, Java and C++, but am a very fast learner and can adapt to any situation.
